## What They Do

The Riverside Park Conservancy does the bulk of the care and maintenance of Riverside Park, stretching along the Hudson from the 50s to the 150s,
in addition to a variety of public prorgams.
The conservancy is a nonprofit with a handful of full-time staff, supplemented by local volunteers, and collaborates with
the NYC parks department.

Enjoy the parks!

In addition to miles of public parks, Jenny's Garden near 138th St. features community gardening beds for those with a green thumb wanting to grow
their own veggies. It's very popular, and as such there's a waiting list.
