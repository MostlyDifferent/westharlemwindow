## What They Do

"Supply Fresh Food to Those Who Need It Most" -- fresh, seasonal produce from local farms with an emphasis on serving low-income and communities of color.

## Go to them for...

Corbin Hill runs a Farm Share, sometimes called a [CSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community-supported_agriculture).

Every week, Corbin Hill distributes boxes of fresh seasonal produce to the local community. As part of their mission, Corbin Hill provides this
at an inexpensive rate for low-income local residents, including those on SNAP/EBT.

The program is not only for low-income residents, however. Anyone is welcome to sign up and take advantage of fresh seasonal
produce. Those who can afford more are encouraged to consider the "Social Impact Shareholder" plan to help subsidize your neighbors in need.

The Corbin Hill farm share distributes at [several locations](http://corbinhill-foodproject.org/locations), including every Wednesday afternoon 
in front of [Brotherhood / Sister Sol](/orgs/brotherhoodsistersol) in the plaza at Amsterdam between 143-144.

**You must [SIGN UP](http://corbinhill-foodproject.org/sign-up) in advance to participate.** There is also a small youth farmers market at the same site
on Wednesdays, a separate service from the CSA/Farm Share.
