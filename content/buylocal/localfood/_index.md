There are several ways to buy fresh food that is locally produced. Consider the following:

[CSAs](csa) - A box of produce delivered from a local farm, either to a set distribution point,
or directly to your door.

[Farmers Markets](farmersmarkets) - Local open-air markets, operating on specific days, where vendors from local farms
sell fresh fruits, veggies, meat, cheese, etc.
