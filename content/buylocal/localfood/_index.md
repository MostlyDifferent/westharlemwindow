There are several ways to buy fresh food that is locally produced. Consider the following:

[CSAs](/buylocal/localfood/csa) - A box of produce delivered from a local farm, either to a set distribution point,
or directly to your door.

[Farmers Markets](/buylocal/localfood/farmersmarkets) - Local open-air markets, operating on specific days, where vendors from local farms
sell fresh fruits, veggies, meat, cheese, etc.
