### GrowNYC

[GrowNYC](https://www.grownyc.org/greenmarket/ourmarkets) helps manage many NYC Farmers Markets. At their site, you can
use the interactive map, or click "Show/hide a text list of all Greenmarket/Farmstand locations." GrowNYC's markets accept
a variety of food assistance options, including SNAP/EBT, by way of tokens available at the GrowNYC table at the market.

Nearest to West Harlem are:
- [Columbia Sunday](https://www.grownyc.org/greenmarket/manhattan/columbia-su) (115th and Broadway)
- [Columbia Thursday](https://www.grownyc.org/greenmarket/manhattan/columbia-th) (115th and Broadway)
