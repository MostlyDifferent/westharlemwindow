A CSA, or Community Supported Agriculture, is a program where individuals can purchase a "share" from local farms. This
share typically entitles you to a box of produce on a regular basis, often weekly, throughout the growing season. It may
consist of fruits and vegetables, and sometimes also meat, dairy, and other products. Some CSAs offer a variety of options
depending on your needs and preferences. 

Typically, the exact items in the box will be a surprise, chosen from seasonal items freshly 
harvested this week. Some will allow you to subscribe on a weekly basis, though many will request that you
commit to an entire season.
