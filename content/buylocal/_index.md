Many of the things we buy on a daily basis are made and distributed by large corporations, and/or transported great distances.
And for many of these things, there are local options, whether it's a product made here in the neighborhood, or food grown
on nearby farms.

Some businesses, like barber shops and mom & unique local restaurants, "local" is built in... you just walk out your door
and there it is. But for others, finding something local can be a bit trickier.
