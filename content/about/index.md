Hello to everybody! Welcome to West Harlem Window, a resource page for Hamilton Heights and the vicinity.

This page came about during the Coronavirus lockdown, when some discussion on Nextdoor.com brought to light that locals didn't know what restaurants were open for takeout.

It occurred to me that there was no resource for locals in west Harlem to find out things like that, and also community resources and maybe a bit of news and who needs help.

The social media paradigm is fleeting, and you only ever really have easy access to information from the past few days, maybe the past week, and only what happens to show up in your news feed.

So consider this a bit more of a consistent, persistent spot of helpful information. Great local spots to support. Maybe some events. How to help each other out. How to get help. How to shop local.

I'm just some guy that's lived in this part of town 7 years now, and finds this to be one of the most amazing corners of one of the most amazing cities. The diversity of people, the life on the streets, the music, the domino games, the homemade tamales, the cafes. And I hope that, in some small part, during these funky tricky times, I can help out in some way.
