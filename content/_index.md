Welcome to West Harlem Window, a resource for Hamilton Heights, Manhattanville, Sugar Hill, and the vicinity.

This site focuses primarily on the area between 125th and 155th St, from the Hudson to St. Nicholas and Jackie Robinson Parks.
We'll also cover resources extending into Washington Heights to the north, Morningside Heights to the south, and Central Harlem to the east.

Please don't hesitate to contact westharlemwindow@gmail.com with any feedback... corrections, additions,
requests for information, etc. If your organization, cause, site, or business isn't on here, or if there's information
you want that I don't have up here, I may not know about it or may not have gotten to it yet. Tell me and I'll get on it!
