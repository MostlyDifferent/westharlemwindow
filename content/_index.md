Welcome to West Harlem Window, a resource for Hamilton Heights and the vicinity.

This site primarily serves the area between 125th and 155th St from the Hudson to St. Nicholas and Jackie Robinson Parks.
Much that's posted here may also overlap into neighboring areas within walking distance,
including parts of Washington Heights to the north, Morningside Heights to the south, and Harlem proper toward
the east.

Please don't hesitate to contact westharlemwindow@gmail.com with any feedback... corrections, additions,
requests for information, etc.
