Welcome everybody to West Harlem Window! This site was envisioned as a resource for the local community during the COVID-19 shutdown.

This has always been an amazing neighborhood, but the shutdown has kept us cooped up close to each other much more than usual.
This has provided us both with an opportunity to get to know our own neighborhood better, and also with a more urgent necessity to be there for each other.

I'm hoping that this site can help us to do both of these, to learn to appreciate each other more, and keep as much of our local flavor intact as things are... crunchy.

How far this site goes, how long it will stick around, I don't know. I could see it becoming a touchstone of local news and a repository of local resources.
Or perhaps it's just a list of local restaurants that's useful for a couple months and then disappears into the void.

Regardless, thanks for visiting, I hope it's been helpful, and don't hesitate to reach out to [westharlemwindow@gmail.com](mailto:westharlemwindow@gmail.com) with any feedback.
