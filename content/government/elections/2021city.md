2021 New York City Elections. Primary will be on June 22nd.

This could be a very exciting election, as it is the first election in which NYC will vote via Ranked Choice voting.
That is, voters will have an opportunity to rank their first, second, third, etc. choices for each office.

There are a LOT of candidates, and the list is still growing. Below is the best information I have as of early September 2020.
